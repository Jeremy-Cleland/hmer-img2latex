# Image to LaTeX Converter: Comprehensive Project Report

## Introduction

The Image to LaTeX (img2latex) project implements a deep learning-based system for converting images of mathematical expressions into LaTeX code. This technology addresses a significant challenge in digital document processing: transforming visual representations of mathematical formulas into their corresponding markup representation, which is essential for editing, searching, and accessibility.

Mathematical expressions are ubiquitous in scientific, engineering, and academic literature, but transferring them between different formats can be cumbersome. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems often struggle with the complex two-dimensional structure of mathematical formulas. The img2latex project provides an end-to-end solution to automatically recognize and transcribe mathematical expressions from images, significantly reducing the manual effort required for digitizing printed mathematical content.

The system employs a sequence-to-sequence architecture, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or residual networks (ResNets) for image encoding with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for LaTeX sequence decoding. This approach leverages recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing to achieve state-of-the-art performance in formula recognition.

## Data Analysis and Processing

### Dataset Characteristics

The img2latex system uses the IM2LaTeX-100k dataset, which contains 103,536 images of mathematical expressions paired with their corresponding LaTeX code. Our comprehensive analysis of the dataset revealed:

- **Image Dimensions**:
  - Width: Range from 128 to 800 pixels (mean: 319.2px)
  - Height: Range from 32 to 800 pixels (mean: 61.2px)
  - Aspect Ratio: Range from 1.00 to 15.00 (mean: 5.79)
  - Most Common Size: 320×64 pixels (11,821 images)

- **Color and Pixel Analysis**:
  - Mode: All images are RGB (3 channels)
  - Data Type: uint8 (0-255 range)
  - Pixel Statistics: Mean value = 241.51, Standard deviation = 46.84
  - Background: Predominantly white backgrounds

### Preprocessing Pipeline

Based on our dataset analysis, we implemented a sophisticated preprocessing pipeline:

1. **Resizing**:
   - All images are resized to a fixed height of 64 pixels while maintaining the original aspect ratio
   - This standardization addresses the variable height issue while preserving the structural integrity of formulas

2. **Padding**:
   - Images are padded to a uniform width of 800 pixels to accommodate the widest formulas without information loss
   - Right-padding with white background matches the original image aesthetics

3. **Channel Conversion**:
   - For CNN models: Images are converted to grayscale (1 channel) to reduce computational overhead
   - For ResNet models: RGB format (3 channels) is maintained to leverage pre-trained weights

4. **Normalization**:
   - ToTensor(): Converts uint8 [0,255] to float [0,1] range
   - Normalize(): Standardizes using appropriate means and standard deviations for the model type

5. **Data Augmentation** (training only):
   - Small rotations (±5°): Enhances robustness to slight misalignments
   - Slight scaling (±10%): Improves scale invariance
   - Random crops with padding: Increases position invariance

The LaTeX formulas undergo tokenization using a custom `LaTeXTokenizer` class, which:
- Handles special LaTeX tokens and commands as single tokens
- Implements vocabulary building with frequency-based filtering
- Limits sequence length to a maximum of 141 tokens (the 95th percentile of the dataset formula lengths)
- Adds special tokens for sequence start (`<sos>`), end (`<eos>`), padding (`<pad>`), and unknown tokens (`<unk>`)

## Model Architecture

Our img2latex system implements two distinct neural network architectures, each with specific strengths and applications.

### CNN-LSTM Architecture

The CNN-LSTM model, our primary implementation, consists of:

#### Encoder: Convolutional Neural Network
The encoder processes the input image through a series of convolutional layers:

- **Structure**: Three convolutional blocks, each containing:
  - Conv2D layer with filter sizes [32, 64, 128] and 3×3 kernels
  - Batch normalization for training stability
  - ReLU activation for introducing non-linearity
  - MaxPooling layer (2×2) for dimensionality reduction

- **Feature Extraction**: The final convolutional layer produces a feature map representing the spatial features of the formula image

- **Embedding Generation**: The feature map is flattened and passed through a fully connected layer to create a fixed-size embedding that captures the visual information

#### Decoder: LSTM with Attention

The decoder is an LSTM-based recurrent neural network that generates the LaTeX sequence:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts token indices to dense vectors of fixed size (256 dimensions)

- **LSTM Cells**: Two stacked LSTM layers with hidden state dimension of 256
  - Process embeddings sequentially
  - Maintain state information across the sequence
  - Apply dropout (0.2) between layers for regularization

- **Attention Mechanism**: Bahdanau attention that:
  - Calculates attention weights between decoder state and encoder features
  - Allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input image when generating different tokens
  - Significantly improves performance for complex formulas with spatial relationships

- **Output Layer**: A fully connected layer that projects the LSTM output to vocabulary size, followed by softmax to obtain token probabilities

### ResNet-LSTM Architecture

The ResNet-LSTM model replaces the CNN encoder with a pre-trained ResNet:

#### Encoder: Residual Network
- **Base Model**: Pre-trained ResNet (options include ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152)
  - Leverages transfer learning from models trained on ImageNet
  - Classification head removed to extract feature maps

- **Adaptation Layer**: Custom layer that:
  - Processes the feature maps from the final ResNet layer
  - Adjusts the channel dimensions to match decoder requirements
  - Maintains spatial information critical for attention mechanism

- **Transfer Learning Options**:
  - Full fine-tuning: All weights updated during training
  - Partial freezing: Early layers frozen, later layers fine-tuned
  - Feature extraction: ResNet completely frozen, only adapter layers trained

#### Decoder
The decoder is identical to the CNN-LSTM architecture, ensuring comparable generation capabilities while benefiting from the enhanced feature extraction of ResNet.

## Training Methodology

The training process implements several key strategies for efficient and effective learning:

### Optimization Setup

- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with:
  - Initial learning rate: 0.001
  - Weight decay: 0.0001 for regularization
  - Beta parameters: (0.9, 0.999)

- **Learning Rate Scheduling**:
  - ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces learning rate when validation metrics plateau
  - Patience of 3 epochs with reduction factor of 0.5
  - Minimum learning rate threshold of 1e-6

- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss with:
  - Label smoothing (0.1) to prevent overconfidence
  - Padding token indices ignored in loss calculation

### Training Techniques

- **Teacher Forcing**: During training, the decoder receives:
  - Ground truth tokens as input with probability proportional to training progress
  - Previously predicted tokens with increasing probability as training advances
  - This scheduled sampling approach bridges training/inference discrepancy

- **Gradient Clipping**: Norm-based clipping (value: 5.0) to prevent exploding gradients

- **Early Stopping**: Training stops if validation loss doesn't improve for 5 consecutive epochs

- **Checkpointing**: 
  - Regular saving of model weights at each epoch
  - Best model saved based on validation BLEU score
  - Training state saved for resumption capability

### Hardware Acceleration

- **Device Support**:
  - CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs
  - MPS for Apple Silicon (M-series)
  - CPU fallback for systems without GPU acceleration

- **Mixed Precision Training**: 
  - FP16 computation where supported
  - Reduces memory usage by up to 50%
  - Speeds up training by 30-40% on compatible hardware

## Inference Methods

During inference, the model offers three decoding strategies:

### Greedy Search
- Selects the most probable token at each step
- Fast and deterministic, but can lead to suboptimal sequences
- Used for real-time applications where speed is critical

### Beam Search
- Maintains multiple candidate sequences (beam size: configurable, default 3)
- Evaluates sequences based on cumulative log probability
- Parameters:
  - Length normalization factor: 0.7 to counter bias toward shorter sequences
  - Maximum sequence length: 150 tokens
  - Early stopping when all beams reach end token

### Sampling with Controls
- Introduces controlled randomness in token selection:
  - Temperature: Adjusts probability distribution sharpness (default: 0.8)
  - Top-k: Limits selection to k most probable tokens (default: 40)
  - Top-p (nucleus sampling): Selects from tokens comprising probability mass p (default: 0.9)
- Useful for generating diverse outputs for ambiguous inputs
