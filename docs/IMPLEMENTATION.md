# Implementation Details for Im2LaTeX

## Changes Made Based on Dataset Analysis

After conducting a comprehensive analysis of all 103,536 images in the Im2LaTeX dataset, we've implemented the following optimizations:

### 1. Image Preprocessing Pipeline

We updated the image preprocessing pipeline to handle the variable-sized images more effectively:

- **Standardized Dimensions**:
  - Fixed height at 64 pixels (most common in dataset)
  - Padded width to 800 pixels (maximum in dataset)
  - Maintained aspect ratio during resizing
  
- **Model-Specific Processing**:
  - CNN: RGB to grayscale conversion (1 channel)
  - ResNet: Kept as RGB (3 channels) with ImageNet normalization

- **Normalization**:
  - All images converted from uint8 [0-255] to float [0-1]
  - CNN: Further normalized to [-1, 1] range
  - ResNet: Applied ImageNet normalization (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])

### 2. File Changes

#### Configuration (`config.yaml`)
- Updated image dimensions for both CNN and ResNet models:
  - `img_height`: 64 (was 50 for CNN, 224 for ResNet)
  - `img_width`: 800 (was 200 for CNN, 224 for ResNet)

#### Dataset Processing (`dataset.py`)
- Changed default image sizes in `create_data_loaders()`
- Implemented aspect ratio-preserving resizing and padding in `_create_default_transforms()`
- Used model-appropriate normalization

#### Image Utilities (`utils.py`)
- Enhanced `load_image()` to:
  - Resize height while maintaining aspect ratio
  - Pad width with white to reach target width
  - Apply appropriate normalization based on model type

#### Predictor (`predictor.py`)
- Updated image size parameters to match our standardized dimensions
- Ensured consistent preprocessing between training and inference

### 3. Implications

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Information Preservation**: No loss of formula content due to aspect ratio distortion
2. **Consistency**: Same preprocessing applied during both training and inference
3. **Model Optimization**: Each model receives input in its preferred format (grayscale for CNN, RGB with ImageNet normalization for ResNet)
4. **Dataset Fidelity**: Dimensions chosen based on actual dataset characteristics, not arbitrary values

## Testing

We've tested the implementation by:
1. Creating visualizations of the preprocessing pipeline
2. Verifying that the pipeline handles edge cases (very wide or narrow images)
3. Ensuring consistency between training data processing and inference

## Further Improvements

Potential future improvements include:
- Dynamic batch padding (pad to batch-specific maximum width instead of global maximum)
- Custom normalization based on dataset statistics (mean=241.51, std=46.84)
- Data augmentation specific to formula images
